# **Ethical Reflection**

## Potential Bias and Migration Strategies:

### Potential Biases:

1. **Demographic Bias:** The breast cancer dataset may underrepresent certain demographic groups, leading to unequal prediction accuracy across populations.

2. **Feature Selection Bias:** Important clinical factors not captured in the dataset could lead to misprioritization.

3. **Historical Bias:** Training data reflects past medical practices that may not represent current best practices.

### IBM AI Fairness 360 Mitigation:

1. **Bias Detection:**  Use fairness metrics to identify disparities in model performance across different subgroups.

2. **Pre-processing:** Apply reweighting techniques to balance underrepresented classes in training data.

3. **In-processing:** Use adversarial debiasing during model training to reduce dependency on sensitive attributes.

4. **Post-processing:** Adjust decision thresholds for different groups to ensure equitable outcomes.

### Implementation Strategy:

- Regular fairness audits using AIF360 toolkit.
- Diverse dataset collection and augmentation.
- Transparent model documentation and validation.
- Continuous monitoring of deployment outcomes.
